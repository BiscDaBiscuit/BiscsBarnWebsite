# BiscsBarnWebsite
*A more advanced website made in Python, HTML, and CSS.*

**Official Website:** __*https://biscsbarnwebsite.biscdabiscuit.repl.co/*__ 

## Information
**Only works on replit unless modified by you directly.**

*The first few versions of this website were made with an Account System but it has been deleted as it isnt needed and there were certain bugs with it.
This website now is much simpler but also the same in appearance, be sure to note that it is unfinished and is still being worked on when I want to/can.*

### Requirements
*Flask*


# Security MD

*You may also access this policy in the SECURITY.md file.*

## Supported Versions

*As of now, versions 2.0 and above are safe and this is because versions 1.5 and below have an unsafe account system. Meaning those few who go through the code and find someone who has used an earlier version can see all accounts emails and username (Unless you make changes yourself).*


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0 >   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.5   | :x:                |

## How To Avoid Vulnerabilities

*Currently the only way to avoid these vulnerabilities are to only use versions 2.0 and above, or you can make changeds to those earlier versions yourself.

I am not responsible if you or any others have personal information leaked/stolen when you use version 1.5 and below. You also must no that having an account on those earlier website does not mean much, it was a way to identify whom signed up onto my website at the time. (The account system was made more fun/testing and I dont plan on using on for a long while on this wesbite.)*
