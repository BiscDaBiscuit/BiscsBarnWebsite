# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of now, versions 2.0 and above are safe and this is because versions 1.5 and below have an unsafe account system. Meaning those few who go through the code and find someone who has used an earlier version can see all accounts emails and username (Unless you make changes yourself).


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0 >   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.5   | :x:                |

## How To Avoid Vulnerabilities

Currently the only way to avoid these vulnerabilities are to only use versions 2.0 and above, or you can make changeds to those earlier versions yourself.

I am not responsible if you or any others have personal information leaked/stolen when you use version 1.5 and below. You also must no that having an account on those earlier website does not mean much, it was a way to identify whom signed up onto my website at the time. (The account system was made more fun/testing and I dont plan on using on for a long while on this wesbite.)
